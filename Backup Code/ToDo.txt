-- move all namespace event handler outside other event handler to avoid looping
-- update all ability to use GUID when checking auraData

-- make aura updates as efficient as possible
-- add better event coverage for aura data updates

-- maybe add a cast potency to low health group units so instant cast abilities will become top priority
-- add separate settings for raid frames ?
-- auto hide one of the text if texts overlap on each other
